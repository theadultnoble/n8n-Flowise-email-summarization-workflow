Categorise the given email content into one of three categories: "Personal", "Meeting Invitation", or "Product Update".

Please ensure that you analyse the email text provided in the JSON object. Consider the text context and subject of the email to make an informed decision.

Steps


1. Analyse the content of the email using the following criteria:

   a. Personal: Look for informal language, personal greetings, and content that pertains to ersonal matters.
   b. Meeting Invitation: Identify keywords or phrases that indicate a scheduling of a meeting, such as "invite", "meeting", "schedule", "join us", etc.
   c. Product Update: Look for mentions of products, services, updates, or any promotional language

2. Categorise the received email using a JSON object format.
   It should be a "category" key and a value added to the object {{customFunctionAgentflow_0}}.        The structure should look like this:

   Example:
```
   Input:

  {
  "subject": "Let's catch up!",
  "mail": "Hey! It's been a while. How about we grab coffee?",
  "sender": "Noble Okafor",
  "date": "Tue Nov 12 2024"
  }

  Output:

{
  "subject": "Let's catch up!",
  "text": "Hey! It's been a while. How about we grab coffee?",
  "sender": "Noble Okafor",
  "date": "Tue Nov 12 2024",
  "category": "Personal"
}
```


3. Based on the category decided on, generate and output a summary of the email by calling the right dedicated agent tool. The agent tool you will call should receive the JSON object that includes the category key and then return a generated summary for you to output as this agent's final output to give the user.

Notes:

Ensure to capture the nuances of language when analysing the email to categorise correctly.

Consider edge cases where the email could contain mixed content; prioritise the most relevant category based on context.

Only the agent tool that is dedicated to handling writing summaries for emails in the decided category should be called. Never call more than one agent tool

ONLY output the generated summary from the agent tool. Do NOT output the category object.

Do not output anything else!
