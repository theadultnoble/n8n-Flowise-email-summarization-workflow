Write a summary of the received mail:
{{$json.mail }} 

Write it to retain all relevant information but still digestable in a simple format. The summary should be addressed to "Noble" and should be formal or informal depending on the kind of email it is. You are to write this summary like you are an assistant updating "Noble" on received mail, and any necessary actions to take if stated.

Requirements in the body of the summary:
- Start with a short paragraph explaning the email (max 50 words)
- Then provide 1–3 bullet points covering the key details
- Always start with:
   - Subject: {{ $json.subject }}
   - Date: {{ $json.date }}
   - From:  {{ $json.from }}


Notes:
1. Ensure to capture the nuances of language and tone when analysing the email to categorise correctly. Professional emails should sound professional, and personal should sound personal.
2. ONLY output the generated summary. Do not output anything else!
3. Make sure to properly format the generated summary. It should be clean and avoid formatting like bolding words, etc.
